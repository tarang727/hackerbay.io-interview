# hackerbay.io-interview

Hackerbay interview test for both backend and frontend.

## Structure

`/backend` - This is the backend test. It implements a rest api that can login user, authorize user, perform json patching functionalities and perform image resize that becomes a thumbnail.

`/maze-gamer` - This is the frontend test. It is implemented in `typescript` due to the logic required. It uses react.js and redux plus **a certain ui framework**.
